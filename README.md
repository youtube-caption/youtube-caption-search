# Youtube Caption Search
### by Joon Ha Kim & Yun Bin Chang [@Techbless](https://github.com/techbless)

Ctrl + F for Youtube.

Version 1.0.0

When watching captioned videos on YouTube, it is easy to miss words and very difficult to find the specific time at which that word was used. With this chrome-extension, you can look up your word on the video, and get the timestamped link of that word.

HOW-TO-USE:

1. Go on any YouTube video that supports captions. 
2. The default language is either English, or the first options from the captions list supported by the video.
3. To change the caption-language, RIGHT-CLICK for the drop-down menu to pop up.
4. Search, Click, and Watch.

For any questions or problems regarding the extension, please feel free to contact us at:
